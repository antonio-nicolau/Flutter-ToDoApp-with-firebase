## Getting Started

To get start with this project you'll need to first of all clone it locally ðŸ˜œ

After that you'll need to run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies used in this project

Since I am using Firebase, you `must`create a firebase project and enable `Firestore Database` & `Firebase Auth` in the Firebase console.
You can follow this [Firebase CLI Guide](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli) to create a new project using Firebase CLI. 

After configure your Firebase project by running `flutterfire configure` a new file `firebase_options.dart` is going to be created. Also `google-services.json` & `GoogleService-info.plist` will be created and BUMM you are ready to run the project ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
